# 🗳️ Sonnaanga... Senjaangala (சொன்னாங்க... செஞ்சாங்களா) — TVK Promise Tracker

> **"சொன்னாங்க... செஞ்சாங்களா?"** — *"Did they keep their word?"* An independent, non-partisan, citizen-driven ledger tracking the election promises made by the newly elected **Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK)** government in Tamil Nadu (elected in 2026), led by Chief Minister C. Joseph Vijay.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Sonnaanga... Senjaangala** is an interactive, transparent tracking dashboard designed to foster civic engagement and hold elected representatives accountable to their manifesto commitments. Every single promise on this platform is sourced directly from the official **TVK 2026 Election Manifesto** and updated exclusively based on publicly verifiable evidence.

This application provides a visual and data-driven view of government performance across various administrative sectors (such as transport, healthcare, education, welfare, and labour), giving citizens, researchers, and journalists an objective source of truth.

---

## ✨ Core Features

*   📊 **Bento-Grid Dashboard (`BentoStats`)**: High-fidelity landing page displaying aggregate statistics, progress counts, and dynamic visualizations of promise statuses.
*   📈 **Evidence Tiers & Verification**: Progress tracking backed by verifiable sources classified into three strict credibility levels.
*   🕒 **Chronological Timelines**: Complete interactive timelines displaying every official government order (GO) or press release associated with a promise.
*   🏷️ **Sectoral Filtering**: Browse promises grouped by sectors (e.g., Women & Transport, Healthcare, Education, Welfare) with harmonious, color-coded categories.
*   📢 **Manifesto Ticker (`ManifestoTicker`)**: A sleek, animated ticker featuring core commitments to keep key promises front and center.
*   ✍️ **Citizen Evidence Submission**: A dedicated contribution portal (`/submit`) allowing citizens to submit new evidence, articles, or Gazette orders to suggest tracking updates.

## 🔍 Methodology & Evidence Tiers

To maintain absolute objectivity, the status of each promise is updated based on a strict three-tier verification standard:

| Tier | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **Official Gazette & GOs** | Government Orders (GOs), official gazette notifications, and assembly-passed legislative bills. *(Highest reliability)* |
| **Tier 2** | **Govt Press Releases** | Official announcements issued directly by the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) or government departments. |
| **Tier 3** | **Credible News & Wires** | Published investigative reports, articles, and coverage from reputable wire agencies (PTI, UNI) and national/state news outlets. |

---

## 🚦 Promise Statuses

Promises transition through the following lifecycle states based on verified evidence:

*   ⚪ **Pending (`pending`)**: The default state. The promise has not yet had any active government orders, budget allocations, or implementation efforts initiated.
*   🔵 **In Progress (`in-progress`)**: Active movement exists—a cabinet approval has been declared, a study committee appointed, or planning/guidelines are officially underway.
*   🟢 **Fulfilled (`fulfilled`)**: The promise has been completely executed. The official Government Order is out, and the physical rollout/disbursal has verified benefits reaching the citizens.
*   🔴 **Evaded (`evaded`)**: The promise has been officially scrapped, delayed indefinitely, or watered down to the extent of violating the original manifesto spirit.

## 🛠️ Root Database & Maintenance Scripts

The repository comes equipped with a suite of Node.js automation and maintenance scripts in the root directory. These scripts process raw data, apply citizen research, update statuses, and structure the database file (`data/promises.json`).

| Script Name | Environment | Purpose / Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`convert_promises.js`** | Node.js | Standardizes raw promise details from raw lists (`new_raw_promises.json`) into the formatted JSON structure used by the Next.js frontend, dynamically assigning unique slugs and sector metadata. |
| **`process_58.js`** | Node.js | Reconciles the 58 core election commitments listed in `promises_list.txt` with existing detailed entries in `data/promises.json` to preserve rich updates while maintaining precise indexing. |
| **`update.js`** | Node.js | A seed and batch-insertion utility to bulk-add a set of newly declared promises to the database with automatic, incremental ID allocation. |
| **`apply_research.js`** | Node.js | Appends new verified sources, updates timestamps, and transitions target promises to the `in-progress` status based on verified state cabinet decisions. |
| **`apply_silverline.js`** | Node.js | *(Legacy — inherited from Kerala fork.)* Custom tracking script for a project-specific cabinet decision; repurposed as a template for recording significant single-promise TVK cabinet decisions. |
| **`add_promise_61.cjs`** | Node.js (CommonJS) | *(Legacy — inherited from Kerala fork.)* Template script for programmatically seeding a single new promise entry with pre-filled manifesto details, CM quotes, and media sources. |
| **`add_promises.cjs`** | Node.js (CommonJS) | *(Legacy — inherited from Kerala fork.)* Template script for safely checking and seeding multiple new promise entries into the JSON ledger without creating duplicates. |
| **`update_colors.cjs`** | Node.js (CommonJS) | Reads through the database and dynamically normalizes sector colors to ensure a cohesive visual theme across all web UI elements. |
| **`inspect_labour.cjs`** | Node.js (CommonJS) | A quick command-line utility to query, filter, and report the current status of all labour and wage-related commitments (Sector `s16`). |

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome citizen contributions to help keep the tracker fully up-to-date:

1.  **Spot a change?** If a promise's status has shifted, or if there is new evidence, head over to the `/submit` page.
2.  **Provide Verifiable Links**: Every suggestion *must* include a URL to a Tier 1 (Gazette/GO), Tier 2 (Government Release), or Tier 3 (Reputed Media) source. Submissions without verifiable links will not be merged.
3.  **Run Maintenance Scripts**: If you are modifying the raw dataset directly or introducing new promises, use the appropriate utility script in the root directory (e.g. `node apply_research.js` or `node update_colors.cjs`) to format and validate the JSON.
